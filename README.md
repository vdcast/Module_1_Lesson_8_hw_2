**Lesson's topic:**

Exceptions.

**Task:**

Let's return to a typical task - processing information from the server. We receive the following data: String name, String lastName, ArrayList<Comment> comments, Reactions reactions. We need to display them (bring them to the log), avoiding possible errors.
As you can see, there are complex data types like Comment. Let it be a class with public fields String authorName, String authorLastName, String text, String date. And the Reactons type has public fields String thumbsUp, String oks, String hearts (they contain numbers for the number of corresponding emotions). Only the sum of all emotions is displayed in the log.
At the start of the program, you initialize all of these variables, like String name = "Ivan"; â€¦
Then you make checks as necessary so that no errors occur with any data that comes in.
Output the verified data to the log.

**Result:**
